-- This script will list all cities in `hbtn_0d_usa`
-- Each record should display: `cities.id`-`cities.name`-`states.name`
-- Results should be ordered in ascending order by `cities.id`
-- You can only use one `SELECT` STATEMENT


SELECT cities.`id`, cities.`name`, states.`name`
FROM `cities` INNER JOIN `states` ON cities.`state_id` = states.`id`
ORDER BY cities.`id` ASC;
