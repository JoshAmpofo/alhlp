# Almost A Circle Project

## Background Context

This project is a precursor to the AirBnB project which is a big part of the Higher level curriculum.

In this project, I reviewed everything about I've learnt so far in Python such as:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file

Additionally I also learned about:

- `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## General Lessons learned

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is `*args` and how to use it
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
