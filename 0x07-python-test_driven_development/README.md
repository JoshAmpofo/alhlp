# Test-Driven Development

The cornerstone of writing good, stable and maintainable code is writing even more robust and efficient tests. Although all test cases cannot be defined, it is still imperative to get into the habit of writing tests for programs we as developers create. 
Hence the goal of this module in the ALX SE program
